The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much
of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The Romans
conquered most of this during the Republic, and it was
ruled by emperors following Octavianâ€™s assumption of
effective sole rule in 27 BC. The western empire
collapsed in 476 AD, but the eastern empire lasted until
the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
