Shivaji had two sons: Sambhaji and Rajaram, who had different mothers and were half-brothers. In
1681, Sambhaji succeeded to the crown after his fatherâ€™s death and resumed his expansionist policies.
Sambhaji had earlier defeated the Portuguese and Chikka Deva Raya of Mysore. To nullify the alliance
between his rebel son, Akbar, and the Marathas /] Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb headed south in 1681
With his entire imperial court, administration and an army of about 500,000 troops, he proceeded to
expand the Mughal empire, gaining territories such as the sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. During

the eight years that followed, Sambhaji led the Marathas successfully against the Mughals [47]

In early 1689, Sambhaji called his commanders for a strategic meeting at Sangameshwar to consider
an onslaught on the Mughal forces. In a meticulously planned operation, Ganoji and Aurangzeb's,
commander, Mukarrab Khan, attacked Sangameshwar when Sambhaji was accompanied by just a few
men. Sambhaji was ambushed and captured by the Mughal troops on 1 February 1689. He and his
advisor, Kavi Kalash, were taken to Bahadurgad by the imperial army, where they were executed by the
Mughals on 21 March 1689 [48] Aurangzeb had charged Sambhaji with attacks by Maratha forces on
Burhanpur.491

Upon Sambhajis death, his half-brother Rajaram ascended the throne. The Mughal siege of Raigad
continued, and he had to flee to Vishalgad and then to Gingee for safety. From there, the Marathas
raided Mughal territory, and many forts were recaptured by Maratha commanders such as Santaji
Ghorpade, Dhanaji Jadhav, Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi, Shankaraji Narayan Sacheev and Melgiri
Pandit. In 1697, Rajaram offered a truce but this was rejected by Aurangzeb. Rajaram died in 1700 at
Sinhagad. His widow, Tarabai, assumed control in the name of her son Shivaji II.)
